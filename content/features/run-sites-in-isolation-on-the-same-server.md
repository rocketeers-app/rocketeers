slug: run-sites-in-isolation-on-the-same-server
description: When you have multiple sites on a server, the files of these sites are hosted on the same disk. That's why Rocketeers hosts every sites in isolation from each other, this way other sites can't access files outside of its own document root directory. This is done by creating a new user for each site.
