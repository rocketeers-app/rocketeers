Out of the box Laravel has a wide variety of events that are fired inside your application by default.

These events can help you with hooking into functionality and listen for when things are happening. This makes Laravel easily extensible without much effort.

## How to list all events in your Laravel app

If you would like to quickly overview all Laravel events inside your own app, including listeners. Execute the following artisan command:

```bash
php artisan event:list
```
